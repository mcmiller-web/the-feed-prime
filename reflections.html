    <h1 class="h1">THE REFLECTION</h1>
    <br>

    <!-- my reflection text assets and responses -->

    <p class="p">Usually, when I'm on the internet, a significant amount of my time is dedicated to Pinterest, where I collect inspiration for both my personal and professional endeavors. Still, I also make time to explore various random topics, ranging from health and fitness to film and cinema insights, and travel destinations from my bucket list. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Given that research is a constant element of my life at university, the remainder of my free time on the internet is mainly dedicated to schoolwork, leaving little room for "fun internet time" that aligns with my interests beyond my studies. I see this as a positive, since I know I'm being productive with my time on the internet, but my inner child would love to waste time on the web every once in a while.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">A Deep Dive Into Some of My Feed Images</h2>

    <p class="p">This ended up being a decent day during a hectic week—but then again, all my weeks at USF are either busy or hectic. I had come into work very early on this day, and I had a break in between my next shift, so I decided to take a nap in UC 2 to kill time and give my body more time to wake up officially. The picture here is a post-nap shot of a well-rested Maliyah.</p>

    <p class="p">On this day, I was just in the middle of writing a report for my RD in the ResLife department. My sophomore year as a first-time RA has been nothing short of exciting and has involved unexpected situations since moving back to USF for the year. In this case, I used the internet to gather all notes and facts for my report, as well as the writing guide provided by the department to ensure our reports are correctly formatted.</p>

    <p class="p">I had a lot of work to do on this day so I could be free for the weekend, and I was bouncing back and forth between my Google Calendar and inboxes from both my school and personal Gmail accounts. My stomach had just growled, and I was in desperate need of a quesadilla, but I needed to get all these emails done beforehand so I could intently focus on crafting the perfect meal.*chef's kiss*</p>

    <h2 class="h2">What I hope the internet will be like in the future?</h2>
    
    <p class="p">In the future, I hope the Internet will have more authentic spaces where people share genuine and "handcrafted" work with the world, given that we'll have hundreds of technological tools to use by then. I'd want fewer people to be controlled by these dominating social platforms, such as Instagram and X, and instead have platforms that are created by people, for people, with an interconnected network that doesn't force everyone to compete for "airtime" on the Internet. 
        <br>
        <br>I'd also want the youth on the Internet to have more restricted access to content and online material that is vulgar and too mature for them. This would mainly involve better regulations on what content is directed at whom and the use of content walls, at least to a degree that would minimize the exposure better than the systems we have now.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Life Online in CONTRAST to Life IRL?</h2>
    
    <p class="p">When I think about the contrasts of life online vs. life in real life, I think about the authenticity of it all. Though we have people who do express their authentically real selves and everyday lives (even more so now), we still have to acknowledge or understand that at the end of the day, there’s a side of them that we won’t actually be able to see simply because we’re not really connecting with them on an organic level. 
        <br>
        <br>In real life, as you navigate the world and interact with people, your authentic connection of face-to-face impressions is what leads you to growing a network of people and influences that will pour into how to present yourself and view the world. And if you’re lucky, some of those connections will grow so deep that you do actually get to see the whole person and persona of an individual—and that’s part of what makes life worth living and existing in reality for. As hard as it is (even for myself), stay away from screens and touch grass, y’all!</p>
